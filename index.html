                    <p>Hello darkness, my old friend<br>
                    I've come to talk with you again<br>
                    Because a vision softly creeping<br>
                    Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
                    And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
                    Still remains<br>
                    Within the sound of silence</p>

                    <p>In restless dreams, I walked alone<br>
                    Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
                    'Neath the halo of a streetlamp<br>
                    I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
                    When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
                    That split the night<br>
                    And touched the sound of silence</p>

                    <p>And in the naked light, I saw<br>
                    Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
                    People talking without speaking<br>
                    People hearing without listening<br>
                    People writing songs that voices never shared<br>
                    No one dared<br>
                    Disturb the sound of silence</p>

                    <p>"Fools", said I, "You do not know<br>
                    Silence like a cancer grows<br>
                    Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
                    Take my arms that I might reach you"<br>
                    But my words like silent raindrops fell<br>
                    And echoed in the wells of silence</p>

                    <p>And the people bowed and prayed<br>
                    To the neon god they made<br>
                    And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
                    In the words that it was forming<br>
                    And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls<br>
                    In tenement halls"<br>
                    And whispered in the sounds of silence</p>
